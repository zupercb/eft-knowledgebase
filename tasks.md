		- PAY HIGHER INSURANCE ** REVISION WAS MADE IN OFFICIAL GAME 10.0.10
	- SKILL PROGRESSION
		THERE SHOULD BE NO SKILL PROGRESSION
			BUFFS SHOULD ONLY BE ON PARTS, STIMS, ETC - BASE CHARACTER STAYS THE SAME
			LEAVE THE FAKE LVL THOUGH, MAYBE CHANGE TO RANKS
	- FLEA MARKET IS GONE, CHANGE TO AUCTION HOUSE
		YOU CAN SELL TO AUCTION, AND AUCTION WILL RESELL IN A MUCH HIGHER PRICE.
